    - subject: Rename binary to snakecase and add .exe for windows in postinstall
      hash: 764fdcf67831120284d2b0ecd3951ac906fd846f
      body: |
        node-pre-gyp expects binaries without dashes, and renaming to add .exe
        for windows is easier in postinstall as module_name in package.json
        is only defined as balena_compose_go. This doesn't support a windows
        binary which would have been named balena_compose_go.exe.

    - subject: Release binaries with .node extension
      hash: 9d0581b9ac30ce105c74e04902ec4e66cae2fb74
      body: |
        node-pre-gyp expects .node binaries when downloading and won't
        extract non-.node extension binaries properly. This commit releases
        binaries as .node, and on postinstall, removes the .node extension
        from the downloaded binary.
