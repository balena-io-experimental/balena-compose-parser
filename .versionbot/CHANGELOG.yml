    - subject: Release binaries with .node extension
      hash: 9d0581b9ac30ce105c74e04902ec4e66cae2fb74
      body: |
        node-pre-gyp expects .node binaries when downloading and won't
        extract non-.node extension binaries properly. This commit releases
        binaries as .node, and on postinstall, removes the .node extension
        from the downloaded binary.
